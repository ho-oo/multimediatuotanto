    </li>
    
    <li>Disney's Magical Quest, known in Japan as Mickey's Magical Adventure (ミッキーのマジカルアドベンチャー Mikī no Majikaru Adobenchā?), is a Disney platform game trilogy released by Capcom. The games star Mickey Mouse and, (depending on the game version), either Minnie Mouse or Donald Duck, who must defeat Peg-Leg Pete. The gameplay is similar among all games in the series: the player must move as in a typical platform game, defeating enemies either by jumping on them or by grabbing and throwing blocks at them.</li>
    
    
    <li>One of the most notable gameplay features of the series is the ability to change characters' outfits, which give characters different special abilities. Other gameplay elements in the series include the ability to expand the player's health meter by collecting special hearts, and to shop for items using coins that are scattered throughout the game. </li>
    
    
    <li>Mickey Mouse, Pluto, Goofy and Donald Duck are playing catch in the park. When it is Goofy's turn to throw the ball, he accidentally throws it too far. Pluto runs off chasing the ball and Goofy runs after Pluto, leaving Mickey alone. Mickey goes searching for his friends after a while, but falls down a cliff into a strange magical land. Later, Mickey meets an old wizard who tells Mickey that Pluto was taken by the evil king Pete. Mickey sets out to find his friend and stop Pete's tyranny.</li>
