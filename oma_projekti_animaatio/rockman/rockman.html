    <li>Rockman</li>
    
    <li>Lega Man, known as Rockman (ロックマン Rokkuman?) in Japan, is an action-platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The first game of the Mega Man franchise and original video game series, it was released on December 17, 1987 in Japan, and localized for North America in December 1987 and Europe in May 1990, respectively. Mega Man was produced by a small team specifically for the home console market, a first for Capcom, who previously focused on arcade titles.</li>
    <li>LThe game begins the struggle of the humanoid robot and player-character Mega Man against the mad scientist Dr. Wily and the six Robot Masters under his control. Mega Man's nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in a "Robot Master" boss battle that awards the player-character a unique weapon.</li>
    
    
    
    <li>Mega Man consists of six side-scrolling platformer levels freely chosen by the player. In each level, the player-character, Mega Man, fights through various enemies and obstacles before facing a "Robot Master" boss at the level's end. Upon defeating the boss, the player assimilates the Robot Master's signature attack, or "Master Weapon", into Mega Man's arsenal for the rest of the game.[11] Unlike the standard blaster, the Robot Master powers have limited ammunition replenished by collecting ammunition cells dropped by defeated enemies at random.[11] Enemies also drop energy cells that replenish Mega Man's health gauge.[10] While the player is free to proceed through the game in any order, each Robot Master is especially vulnerable to a specific weapon, which encourages the player to complete certain stages before others. The player can also revisit cleared levels.</li>
